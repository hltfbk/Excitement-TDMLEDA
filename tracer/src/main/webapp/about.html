    Explore your search results by drilling down and up the medical concepts, their semantic relations, and their mentions in the text.
    
    XYZ is We present a novel text exploration model,
which extends the scope of state-of-the-art
technologies by moving from standard concept-
based exploration to statement-based exploration.
The proposed scheme utilizes the
textual entailment relation between statements
as the basis of the exploration process. A user
of our system can explore the result space of
a query by drilling down/up from one statement
to another, according to entailment relations
specified by an entailment graph and
an optional concept taxonomy. As a prominent
use case, we apply our exploration system
and illustrate its benefit on the health-care
domain. To the best of our knowledge this is
the first implementation of an exploration system
at the statement level that is based on the
textual entailment relation.
