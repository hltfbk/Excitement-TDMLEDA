          Current options:
	      * eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.builders.elementfeature.BidirectionalPredArgElementFeatureExtraction: extract predicate elements, and there arguments (X or Y, according to the following 'slot' feature) as features. 
	        Required features:
                    * slot: denotes whether the features are the X ('X') or the Y ('Y') arguments.
		    * stop-words-file: an optional parameter which denotes the path to a file, composed of stop words (word per line), which should be excluded from the element and/or feature sets.
                    * min-count: minimal number of counts for extracted element.
	      * eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.builders.elementfeature.LemmaPosBasedElementFeatureExtraction, extract elements and features, composed of lemma and part of speech, where the element is the head and the feature is the dependent word. 
	        Required parameters:
                    * include-dependency-relation: denotes whether the features should include the dependency relation (true) or not (false).
                    * stop-words-file: an optional parameter which denotes the path to a file, composed of excluded stop words (word per line).
                    * relevant-pos-list (optional): a list of relevant part-of-speeches for elements and features. In case this parameter is not defined all pos are considered relevant. The name of the pos should be defined in capital letters, according to the enum strings of CanonicalPosTag.
                    * min-count: minimal number of counts for extracted element.-->
