		   Extracts co-occurrences, each composed of two words with their dependency relation, from a given parsed sentences, represented a BasicNode. 
		   Required features:
			* relevant-pos-list: a list of selected part-of-speech for the extracted words. If this feature is not defined, all part-of-speeches will be accepted. The name of the pos should be defined in capital letters, according to the enum strings of CanonicalPosTag.
		* eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.builders.cooccurrence.NodeBasedPredArgCooccurrenceExtraction
		   Extracts co-occurrences, each composed of a binary predicate and one of its arguments with a relation which indicates the position of the argument (X, Y), from a given parsed sentences, represented a BasicNode.
		* eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.builders.cooccurrence.TupleBasedPredArgCooccurrenceExtraction
		   Extracts co-occurrences, each composed of a binary predicate and one of its arguments with a relation which indicates the position of the argument (X, Y), from a given string representation of a tuple of binary predicate and its two arguments.
