EDA: EditDistanceEDA

Description: Given a certain configuration (i.e. the configuration file), the edit distance EDA can be 
trained over a specific data set (i.e. trainDir) in order to optimize its performance (i.e. accuracy or
F1 measure). In the training phase the EDA produces a distance model for the data set, which includes a
distance threshold that best separates the positive and negative examples in the training data. The calculated
threshold is then saved in the configuration file itself. During the test phase the configuration file
is read and the reported threshold used so that T-H pairs resulting in a distance below the threshold are
classified as ENTAILMENT, while pairs above the threshold are classified as NONENTAILMENT. 

EditDistanceEDA uses the weights of the 3 different edit distance operations (i.e. delete, insert, substitute)
reported in the configuration file to calculate the distance between T and H. To calculate this distance 
EditDistance can use either the FixedWeightTokenEditDistance or FixedWeightLemmaEditDistance component.
FixedWeightTokenEditDistance calculates the distance between T and H by using the tokens whereas FixedWeightLemmaEditDistance
uses the lemma of the tokens (in this case a pipeline producing the lemma had to be used for preprocessing the data set).
In addition FixedWeightTokenEditDistance and FixedWeightLemmaEditDistance can exploit external resources like
WordNet and Wikipedia.

From the configuration file it is possible to select different instances of EditDistanceEDA; this is done
by selecting the component to be used (i.e. FixedWeightTokenEditDistance or FixedWeightLemmaEditDistance) and
then one of the available configurations of the selected component (e.g. basic, wordnet, wikipedia).

Basically the configuration file represents a single experiment where information about the used EDA, its
parameters, the data set used to calculate the threshold and the threshold itself are all available. Sharing
a configuration file means allowing other users to replicate the same experiment under the same condition.
