<!-- 
 Description: Given a certain configuration, the EDA - named MaxEntClassificationEDA -
 can be trained over a specific data set in order to optimize its performance based on Maximum Entropy Modeling.
 MaxEntClassificationEDA learns a binary classifier for deciding the entailment problem. The supervised learner
 receives a number of features which are provided through the interplay of different processing components and
 knowledge sources. A configuration file, like this, specifies these components and knowledge sources together
 with settings of the learner.
 
 The common structure of a configuration file for MaxEntClassificationEDA is as follows (for further detail
 also visit https://github.com/hltfbk/Excitement-Open-Platform/wiki/MaxEntClassificationEDA):
 
 - It begins with a specification of platform specific settings in the section "PlatformConfiguration" for
    selecting the EDA, the language and eventually the LPA (Linguistic Pipeline Analysis).
 - It follows the names of the processing components to use, where for each component a separate section is
	defined.
 - As minimal configuration the base processing components named "BagOfWordsScoring" and "BagOfLemmasScoring"
	have to be specified, which provide bag of words and bag of lemmas features.
 - If a processing component also makes use of a knowledge base, then this knowledge base has to be introduced
	via its own section and referenced via the "name" parameter in the corresponding processing component
	that uses this knowledge base.
 - Finally, the parameters for the learning and application phases of the activated EDA have to be specified viz.
	the model file, locations of training and test data, control parameters for the classifier, 
	and the list of components to run.
	Note, that the name of the EDA in the "activatedEDA" property of the "PlatformConfiguration" and the name
	of this last section must be equal.

        <!-- Specifies the maximum accepted amount of derivation steps between two derivationally related lemmas
             to count them as entailment pair. Integer values range between 1 and 10.
             Each pair of lemmas within one derivational family is connected by a set of derivation rules. If one
             lemma l2 can be directly derived from lemma l1, they are connected by one rule, thus, the number of
             derivation steps is one. If l1 derives to l2, and l2 derives to l3, then the pair l1-l3 is connected
             by two derivation steps, etc. The maximum amount of derivation steps to combine two lemmas is ten.
             We assume the following: The more derivation steps must be carried out to connect two lemmas, the less 
             probable it is that these two lemmas are really derivationally related - and thus they are less probable
             to build an enailment relationship. 
             Thus, a low value for the property "derivationSteps" only considers lemmas which are highly probably related.   
             NOTE: This property is only considered if the property "useScores" = true.
